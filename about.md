Welcome to my website, my name is Michael Chinn. I am a graduate of the University of Delaware who started majoring in Electrical Engineering. After three semesters I discovered my calling was not engineering hardware but developing software so I changed majors to a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science.
I enjoyed my years at the University of Delaware where I did not just focused on academics but used my technical skills to help out at the Student Television Network on campus. I have experienced many things due to being part of the TV network, I helped cover the 2008 election, helped televise live football games for both STN 49 and ESPN during the 2010 playoffs, most recently I covered Vice President Biden giving the Constitution Day lecture and donating his senatorial papers to the university. I also joined the Harrington Theater Arts Company and was sound board operator for two shows and the sound designer for the latest, "The Mystery of Edwin Drood."
I was part of an internship program with SevOne Inc. this past summer where I gained not only more advanced computer science knowledge but experience in a workplace. They then hired me again for a winter internship this past January. I am currently employed by JPMorgan Chase as part of the Corporate Development Program where in the first 2 years I will rotate between 3 positions in Mortgage Banking.
