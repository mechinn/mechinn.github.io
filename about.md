Welcome to my website, my name is Michael Chinn.

Since graduating from the University of Delaware in 2012 with a Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science I have been working at JPMorgan Chase & Co.

In my spare time I have a home lab that I have been putting together, over the past few years I have played with a few different tools to manage them. Originally I used QEMU directly, then I learned about Proxmox, after I got a 2nd server I tried out OpenStack and oVirt. Currently I have FreeNAS and Proxmox running various services in my house for me and my friends to use.
