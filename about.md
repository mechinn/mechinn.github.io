Welcome to my website, my name is Michael Chinn. I have a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from the University of Delaware.

Since graduating been working at JPMorgan Chase & Co. in their college graduate rotational program and found myself in a role that fits my interests very well. My title is Database Administrator, specifically I am working on a very large Teradata Active/Passive Database. Most of my time with this team has been utilizing my software engineering skills with my ability to pickup new things very quickly on the fly. I have still not had any formal training working with Teradata but I am probably more skilled than most Teradata DBAs with their Backup and Datamover technology. I helped rework a framework around TARA to be more maintainable and extend some of the capabilities of it. I also have been working on steamlining and enhancing the framework we have around Datamover. Both of these frameworks make it so that these low level tools can be used at scale to move one of the largest databases on the east coast of the United States.

In my free time since graduating high school I have also been a mentor for my high school's FIRST Robotics team, Power Cord 869. I have mostly been mentoring in the pit during competitions due to being located so far away from my home town but I have also guided students specializing in programming remotely and helped setup the team's code repository. Since my senior year of collage I have also been building a scouting app to help the students record vital information on both allies and oponents at competitions. You can learn more about it on my [projects page](/projects/).
